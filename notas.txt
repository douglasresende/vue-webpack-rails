Base webpacked setup completed. Now you can:
1. Include 'Webpacked::ControllerHelper' into 'ApplicationController'
and set up entry points for your controllers via 'webpacked_entry' class method
2. Add the webpacked helpers into your layout instead of regular Rails helpers
3. Run 'npm run dev:server' to start webpack-dev-server or 'foreman start' to start it alongside rails server
